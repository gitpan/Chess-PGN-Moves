Chess/PGN/Moves version 0.05
============================

Chess::PGN::Moves - Perl extension for tabular data in support of Chess::PGN::EPD

Tables:

    %King_Moves
    %Queen_Moves
    %Rook_Moves
    %Bishop_Moves
    %Knight_Moves
    %pawnWhite
    %pawnBlack
    %from_algebraic
    %move_table
    %engWhite
    %engBlack
    %Whiteeng
    %Blackeng

These tables describe all of the possible moves for a given piece. The hash %from_algebraic
provides quick translation from algebraic square notation to a more useful numeric index.
There are 4 additional hash tables; %engWhite, %engBlack, %Whiteeng and %Blackeng that
provide conversion from english descriptive notation to algebraic notation for square names.
